# paris-estate

This script is mainly helpful to get historical information regarding flat price data that I found useful doing my own research.

* Step 1: Get the department information here https://app.dvf.etalab.gouv.fr/
* Step 2: ``python3 check_my_apt.py *some_file.csv*`` 
* Step 3: type in **Street** name as it was printed (of the apt) - if not in list wrong data file!
* Step 4: type in building number from the list
* Step 5: repeat from step 3.


Test out:

```
python3 check_my_apt.py data/92024_0000U.csv
```
